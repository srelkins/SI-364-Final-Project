# SI-364-Final-Project

For my project, I plan to gather data regarding NASA's various missions from the Apollo Program (1963 - 1972) and display this data in an interesting, user-friendly manner. The data will include aspects such as launch date, return date, types of data collected, mission overviews and goals, and other data. This information will come from NASA's online database that gives access to the public regarding various facts and statistics about the missions. Similar websites may be owned by NASA and display data regarding the missions for user consumption. I want to build this website so that it is both educational and interesting for an audience interested in NASA's past missions. I will also provide general information on the purpose and success of the Apollo program for some background information on the topic. I am unsure of what the layout of the website is going to look like, but users will be able to comment on various pages in response to the data provided. I have included the link below to the database for the information regarding the Apollo missions.
